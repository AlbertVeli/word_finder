Small python program that takes a list of letters and a number as input. Then
it picks all permutations of letters of the given length and compares with
words from a wordlist. If the word is found in the wordlist it is printed.

This can be used to find possible solutions to games like for
instance "gissa bilden". The default wordlist is Swedish. If you want
to add another wordlist, gzip it and change the following line:

wordlist = 'dict/svenska.gz'

EXAMPLE

./word_finder.py nrahpkestduv 6

It will print a number of alternatives, one of them is probably correct.
